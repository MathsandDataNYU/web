## Previous

#### Spring 2020

We ran  general group meeting on the broad theme of "Information Theory, Old and New."

- Information and schedule are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImY0mgDkimMS6C1YWE48LQNbC4lWxTAZ9p35rA3HclY/edit?usp=sharing).


#### Fall 2019

We ran a general group meeting on the broad theme of "statistical and computational tradeoffs in high-dimensional inference."

- Information and schedule are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JkM4BRXnrnw7rUJJNVMFldLyYV9_JpSOm8jtZshfWZ4/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Spring 2019

We organized three working groups on different topics:

- The low-degree polynomials method; notes available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11636)
- Nonconvex optimization
- Optimal transport

#### Fall 2018

We ran a working group on the theme of "statistical-to-computational gaps and statistical estimation with algebraic structure."

- [Working group schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvJnx3ynN7wuNc4dX-wu1ujGruVEP97jtuNdpZyR0Ss/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Spring 2017

We ran two simultaneous reading groups:

- [High-dimensional probability](https://github.com/MathsandDataNYU/HighDimProba_spring17), following [Ramon van Handel's notes](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rvan/APC550.pdf)
- [Statistical physics](https://github.com/MathsandDataNYU/StatPhysics_spring17), loosely following [M&#233;zard and Montanari's book](https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/RESEARCH/book.html)
