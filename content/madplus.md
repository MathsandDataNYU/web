+++

We are excited to announce the MaD+ (math and data plus) seminar, jointly organized between NYU and ETH. It is now a virtual seminar series, and depending on logistics and interest potentially evolve to a multi-location seminar once the world returns to normal (with talks hosted in one of the locations, and streamed). The topics will be in line with the physical MaD seminar hosted at the Center for Data Science and the Courant Institute (NYU). Previous speakers of the MaD seminar can be found in http://mad.cds.nyu.edu/seminar/
This semester it runs on Wednesdays in two time slots (each week one time slot) 4pm CET (10am EST) and and 2pm EST (8pm CET), in an attempt to accommodate the various working hours of more researchers around the world.
