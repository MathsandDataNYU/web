### Abstracts
#### <a name='rush'></a> Cynthia Rush: Exact Asymptotics with Approximate Message Passing and a Study of the Type 1-Type 2 Error Trade-off for SLOPE

Approximate message passing (AMP) is a class of iterative algorithms that can be used to systematically derive exact expressions for the asymptotic risk and other performance metrics for estimators that are constructed as solutions to a broad class of convex optimization problems. In this talk, we present a general program for using AMP in this way and we provide a specific example by using this approach to study the asymptotic model selection properties of sorted L1 penalized estimation (SLOPE). Sorted L1 regularization has been incorporated into many methods for solving high-dimensional statistical estimation problems, including using SLOPE in the context of linear regression. We will show how this regularization technique improves variable selection relative to the LASSO by characterizing the optimal SLOPE trade-off between the false discovery proportion and true positive proportion or, equivalently, between measures of type I and type II error. Collaborators on this work include Zhiqi Bu, Jason Klusowski, and Weijie Su (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07502 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13302) and Oliver Feng, Ramji Venkataramanan, and Richard Samworth (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02180).

#### <a name='sarah'></a> Sarah Dean: Participation Dynamics in Learning Systems

The choice to participate in a data-driven system, often made on the basis of the quality of that system, influences the ability of the system to learn and improve. Participation choices manifest as distribution shifts which are partially endogeneous, i.e. caused by the machine learning system itself. In this talk, I will discuss participation dynamics in the presence of multiple learners. We introduce and study a general class of loss-reducing dynamics, in which learners retrain to improve predictive performance and users shift participation towards better performing learners. We characterize the stable equilibria and discuss the implications in terms of social welfare and fairness. Based on joint work with Mihaela Curmei, Maryam Fazel, Jamie Morgenstern, and Lillian Ratliff.

#### <a name='brice'></a> Brice Menard: Opening the neural network black box

I will present a simple point of view allowing us to make sense of the weights in a trained neural network. I will show how to characterize what has been learned, extract quasi-sufficient summary statistics, and use them to generate new networks performing well without any training. I will show that the symmetry group of neural networks are layer-based rotations. When taken into account network weights always converge to the same solution. I will illustrate these results using standard classification tasks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and I will introduce a model that captures all these properties. Finally, I will show that most of the stochasticity inherent to neural networks and their training is largely negligible. Collaborators: F. Guth, S. Mallat & G. Rochette.
