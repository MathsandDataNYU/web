### Abstracts 

#### <a name="ivan"></a> Ivan Selesnick: Sparse Regularization via Convex Analysis


Abstract: Sparse approximate solutions to linear equations are often obtained via L1 norm regularization, but the L1 norm tends to underestimate sparse solutions. We discuss a non-convex alternative to the L1 norm. Unlike other non-convex regularizers, the proposed regularizer maintains the convexity of the objective function to be minimized. This allows one to retain beneficial properties of both convex and non-convex regularization. Although the new regularizer is non-convex, it is defined using tools of convex analysis.  In particular, we define a generalized Huber function and a generalization of the Moreau envelope. The resulting optimization problem can be performed by proximal algorithms.
