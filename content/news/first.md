The Mad (Math and Data) group was created in fall 2016 by 
Afonso Bandeira, Joan Bruna and Carlos Fernandez-Granda, three Assistant 
Professors at the [Courant Institute](http://cims.nyu.edu) and the [Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu). 

We are always in the lookout for highly motivated students interested 
in understanding and developing the fundamental mathematical structures underpinning modern data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and their applications.
