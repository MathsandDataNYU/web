The Mad (Math and Data) group was created in fall 2016 by 
Afonso Bandeira, Joan Bruna and Carlos Fernandez-Granda, three Assistant 
Professors at Courant Institute and the Center for Data Science. 

We are always in the lookout for highly motivated students interested 
in understanding and developing the fundamental mathematical structures underpinning
modern data analysis.
