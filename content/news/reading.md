This week we are starting two weekly reading groups. 
One will study [topics on high-dimensional Probability](https://github.com/MathsandDataNYU/HighDimProba_spring17), 
whereas the other will focus on selected [topics on Statistical Physics](https://github.com/MathsandDataNYU/StatPhysics_spring17). You can check present and past reading groups in the corresponding [page](reading).
